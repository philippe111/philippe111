Hi, I'm Philippe Dewart
I'm a Mathematical engineering student at KU Leuven. In this Git repository I include my personal/school project.
My interests are solving optimisation problems, simulations of PDE's and simulation of stochastic processes. 
Further I have taken a liking in applying the numerical techniques I learnt during my studies to financial mathematics problems.

This repository contains the following projects:

- Simulation of a pandemic using the SIQRD model (Fortran/C++)
- Master's thesis on multilevel markov chain monte carlo methods for data assimilation (Matlab)
- Design of a heat sink (Matlab/C++)
- Financial engineering assignment: Calibration of the Heston model and pricing of a structured product (Python)
- Computer vision assignment (Python)
